## Contributing

This website is designed to be collaborative. We encourage every team member to submit a 
Pull Request (PR) if they notice any issues or wish to propose a new feature or improvement. 
For those unfamiliar with the process, refer to (GitHub's guide on creating a pull request[https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request]) 
for detailed instructions. Several additions are possible on the site. 
Please adhere to the following guidelines to maintain consistency in style:

### 1 - Adding Publications

Each team member is responsible for adding their own publications if they want them to be 
displayed on the site. To add a publication, you can follow this template:

```html
<!-- Example HTML code for a publication -->
<div class="publication">
    <h4>Title of the Publication</h4>
    <p>Author Name(s), Published in Journal Name, Year.</p>
    <a href="link_to_publication">Read more</a>
</div>
```

### 2 - Adding a Team Member

To add a team member, update the `the_team/people.html`.
Add the photo in `images/people/carre/new_member.jpg` (ensure it’s in a square format).

```html
<!-- Example HTML code for a team member -->
<div class="team-member">
    <img src="path_to_photo.jpg" alt="Name">
    <h4>Name</h4>
    <p>Role and short bio.</p>
</div>
```

```html
<!-- Example HTML code for a collaboration -->

    <h3>Collaboration Title</h3>
    <p>Details about the collaboration and participating organizations.</p>
